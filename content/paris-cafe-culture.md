# Paris Café Culture ☕

There's something magical about Parisian cafés. I've spent three days here, and I think I've found my perfect routine: croissant and café au lait for breakfast, followed by hours of people watching.

## Montmartre Morning

My favorite spot so far is Café des Deux Moulins in Montmartre. Yes, it's the café from Amélie! The coffee is strong, the croissants are buttery, and the view of Sacré-Cœur is unbeatable. ⛪

### The Art of People Watching

Parisians have turned sitting at cafés into an art form. Here's what I've learned:
- Never rush your coffee
- Bring a book (even if you don't read it)
- Make eye contact with strangers
- Order "un café" and sip it slowly

## Hidden Courtyards

Behind the busy streets, I discovered these incredible hidden courtyards. Place de Furstenberg is my favorite - it's quiet, beautiful, and has this amazing light that makes everything look like a painting. 🎨

## Evening Ritual

The best time is around 5 PM when the workday ends. Everyone rushes to their favorite terrace for an apéritif. I had the most amazing conversation with an elderly French gentleman about art and life. He barely spoke English, I barely speak French, but we understood each other perfectly. 🇫🇷

Paris isn't just a city - it's a feeling. And that feeling is best experienced from a wicker chair on a sidewalk terrace, coffee in hand, watching the world go by. ✨
